# octupole_masstable
Data analysis of my octupole masstable calculations using HFBTHOv301mc, the calculations are HFB+LN, for Skyrme functionals UNEDF0-2, SLy4, SV-min, SkP, SkM*. The complete calculation took roughly 1.5 million core-hours on iCER Michigan State University. Auxiliary calculations related to octupole softness, stiffness, energy takes roughly 0.5 million c.h. 
The actual table is not provided, because the results are not yet published.
