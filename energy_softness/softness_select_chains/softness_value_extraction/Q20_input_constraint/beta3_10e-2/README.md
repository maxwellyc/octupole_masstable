data0 contains binding energy of beta2 at quadrupole minimum's value and beta3 = 0.01, constrained calculations
  this calculation was performed in the very end, where we have to use the quadrupole beta2 value needed for this calculation.

data1 contains quadrupole ground state binding energy for non-octupole deformed nuclei
  this calculation was performed during the first stage of octupole softness for non-octupole deformed nuclei

data2 contains quadrupole ground state binding energy for octupole deformed nuclei
  this calculation was performed during the octupole energy phase
