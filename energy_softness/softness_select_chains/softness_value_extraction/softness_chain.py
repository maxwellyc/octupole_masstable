# read-in softness base, there'll be two parts
# baseline can be achieved for octupole deformed and non-oct nuclei with:
# 1. octupole nuclei's quad. minimum has been calculated in the octupole energy
# series calculations.
# 2. non-oct quad. are the recently calculated ones that are used to initialize
# softness calculations.

# need to make sure beta2 are exactly the same between the two subtracted states
# so we'll need two columns to compare before and after beta2 values.

# We'll need 3 input files. beta3 = 0.01 file; baseline file for oct and non-oct.
# Also we need to find out non-converged states and see what can be done there.

# Let's first gather the latter two files while waiting for beta3 = 0.01 calculations
