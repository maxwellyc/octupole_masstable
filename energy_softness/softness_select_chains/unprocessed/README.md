Contains quadrupole ground state results for select chains, the quad. beta2 value from these calculations will be used for second stage calculations of setting beta3 = 0.01, 0.02 in order to calculate octupole softness.
The octupole deformed nuclei and not octupole deformed nuclei are calculated separately for historic reasons.
