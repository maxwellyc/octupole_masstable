s1_inputs contains information of quadrupole minimum for octupole deformed and non-octupole deformed nuclei, the two types have separate files for a given EDF, these files contains only select elements where octupole is most prominent: Z = 40, 54, 56, 58, 80, 86~100

s2_inputs contains information of one single isotopic chain, in this test we selected Barium (Z=56), there are 3 columns, Z, N and quadrupole minimum's beta2 value.

s3_inputs is the input for HFBTHO calculation, namely the hfbtho_MASSTABLE.dat file needed for the actual calculations. Note that for the actual calculation the EDF names tagged at the end of the file names should be removed.
