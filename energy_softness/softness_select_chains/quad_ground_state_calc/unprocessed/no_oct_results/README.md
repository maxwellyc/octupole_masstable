This directory contains quadrupole minima calculations for select isotopic chains, the first set of chains are those isotopes with strong octupole candidates, Zr, Ba, Ce, Xe, Hg, Rn, Ra, Th, U, Pu etc.
Note that octupole deformed nuclei are not calculated here because their "softness" have already been calculated in the octupole_deformed directory.

The quadrupole minima from kickoff mode calculation are stored in gs_minima, with reduced info files in "reduced" directory for better readability.

These quad. minima will serve as a starting point for the octupole softness calculations, the octupole softness candidates will be constrained using these quadrupole deformation (beta2) values and beta3 = 0.01, 0.02.



We'll be calculating Ba chains first, as a test. 08/01/19

Note that Gd isotopes have not been included in the first set of chains.
